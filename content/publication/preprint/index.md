title: A Holistic Approach for Aligned Music and Lyrics Transcription
abstract: In this paper, we present the Aligned Music Notation and Lyrics
  Transcription (AMNLT) challenge, whose goal is to retrieve the content from
  document images of vocal music. This new research area arises from the need to
  automatically transcribe notes and lyrics from music scores and align both
  sources of information conveniently. Although existing methods are able to
  deal with music notation and text, they work without providing their proper
  alignment, which is crucial to actually retrieve the content of the piece of
  vocal music. To overcome this challenge, we consider holistic neural
  approaches that transcribe music and text in one step, along with an encoding
  that implicitly aligns the sources of information. The methodology is
  evaluated on a benchmark specifically designed for AMNLT. The results report
  that existing methods can obtain high-quality text and music transcriptions,
  but posterior alignment errors are inevitably found. However, our formulation
  achieves relative improvements of over 80% in the metric that considers both
  transcription and alignment. We hope that this work will establish itself as a
  future reference for further research on AMNLT.
